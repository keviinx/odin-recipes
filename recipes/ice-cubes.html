    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mix 2 cups of water with 2 tablespoons of water. Add more water to taste. "I wish there was a Crock-Pot version
        of this recipe. I work long hours and I just donÂ’t have the time to invest in this kind of hands-on cooking."

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups water (approximately)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water (additional if needed)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Empty the ice cubes that are left in the trays (if there are any left) into the bin.</li>
        <li>Take the trays over to the sink and fill them with cold water. (Hot water will freeze faster and more
            clear).</li>
        <li>Place the water filled ice trays back in the freezer.</li>
        <li>Replace the ice bin if you had to remove it.</li>
        <li>Shut the door to the freezer.</li>
        <li>Be sure to leave for around 4-6 hours at least to make sure it is frozen.</li>
        <li>If you want to experiment, you can freeze things like fruit infused waters or juices.</li>
    </ol>
